# Balance tests: Recap

Let's first refresh our memories by checking balance after we matched with the Euclidean distance last week...

Recall the following: 

Arrington et al. (2021) evaluate whether the processes states use to select judges for high courts influence gender diversity. They use a global sample sine 1970 and a matching design in two stages (exact matching and propensity score matching) to compare treated and control units with the same pretreatment institutions. Treatment is a change in the number of appointers or nominators.

[Here is the paper.](https://www-cambridge-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/constitutional-reform-and-the-gender-diversification-of-peak-courts/D9B56B946416D4582B34D769B3F937F5#supplementary-materials) We will be using only  `women_highcourts.csv`. 

(If curious, you can find the authors' code and original data files [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/RHPSZD)). 

```{r}

# Load the data

```

Let's match by Euclidean distance first on the same variables as last time, and check balance for them...Hint: simply copy-paste your code from last week. 

We are interested in the effect of 
`"treated1"`: or treatment as an increase in the number of nominators/selectors on `"has_there_ever_been_wom"`: which indicates time until the year of appointment of the first woman to a stateâ€™s highest court (ie. 0 in the years prior to appointment and 1 once the first woman is appointed). In the first stage, the authors only match on:

>- `year`
>- `nominators_to_match1` 
>- `selectors_to_match1`

# Matching as before

```{r}
# missing values in outcome, and Match does not like that...so subset data to only include needed columns and omit NAs in the outcome variable


# define X

# define Y

# define treatment 

# perform matching 

# let's now check balance before and after matching

```

# Now, with propensity score

What are the necessary steps? 



For the propensity score weighting, the authors actually take the matched dataset from step 1 and then match again using a different set of variables.

Comment the code below:
```{r}
#First, we need to extract the matched data from the above

#summary.Match(euclidean_matches)

matched <- euclidean_matches$mdata

index.treated <- euclidean_matches$index.treated
index.control <- euclidean_matches$index.control

# # Create match_id based on order of indexes  
match_id <- c(1:length(index.treated), 1:length(index.control))

# Create match id for full data- not just matched observations

full_match_id <- rep(0, nrow(X))

# Assign match ids for those that were matched
full_match_id[order(c(index.treated, index.control))] <- match_id

# Bind back to FULL original data  
new_data <- as.data.frame(cbind(Y, X, Tr,  
                  MatchID = full_match_id))

# merge with all other covariates

## to ensure merging works- we need to make sure the original df has the same dimensions and column names

names(new_data)[c(1, 5)] <- c("has_there_ever_been_wom", "treated1")

new_data_cols <- names(new_data)[1:5]

# Merge with all covariates
highcourts2 <- merge(new_data, highcourts1, by = new_data_cols)

# delete duplicates
highcourts2 <- highcourts2 %>% 
  distinct(record_id, .keep_all = TRUE)

#write.csv(highcourts2, "highcourts2.csv", row.names = F) # 

```

# An aside: Why GML? 

A Generalized linear model (GLM) is a generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have an error distribution other than a normal distribution... hence, more "general"...

GLMs also have a non-linear 'link functions', which links the regression coefficients to the distribution and allows the linear model to generalize.

# Back to matching...

Now, modify the authors' code so that we use our new_data df and the matchID as a covariate instead of their strata variable....

```{r}
#propensity score matching with optmatch


```
Now, let's practice plotting our propensity scores... fill in the "blanks":

```{r}

# get the propensity scores from the model
## note, we add the original df to be able to merge - this is code from lecture

#define treatment for plotting - to create a new df with pscores and the treatment

# Plot pscores, color by treatment group

# now, let's match like the authors do
ps.pm <- pairmatch(psm, data = highcourts2)
summary(ps.pm) # comment on the results

#pulling matches indicator from optmatch into the dataframe
all.equal(names(ps.pm), row.names(highcourts2)) #TRUE
matched_pairs_tr1<-cbind(highcourts2, matches=ps.pm)

# Refit glm on matched data using the same model as above - just so we can plot with the matched data- the pscores should not change

# Predict propensity scores

#Keeping version with all data for generating balance plot later
matched_pairs_tr1_full<-matched_pairs_tr1

# plot again- but only using the matches!!! 

# How effective were the new matches?
```

# Balance Plots

Now, let's check balance again to see if our matching strategy worked

```{r}

# Take a look at the paper-- did we effectively reproduce this table?

```

Did propensity score give us better balance than Euclidean distance matching? Why should it in this example?

# IPW Estimator

Now, if you got this far,  manually calculate the difference in means with IPW...

This requires two steps:
1. 
2. 

```{r}

# Use only matched data

# Calculate weights

# Divide each unitâ€™s weight by the sum of all weights in that group to normalize weights- why do we do this?

# Weighted means 

# Estimate difference in means                            

# Print                             


#Is this an estimate for the ATE or ATT????
```

# If you got this far...        

Repeat with all observations

```{r}
# Calculate weights

# Divide each unitâ€™s weight by the sum of all weights in that group

# Weighted means  


# Estimate DIM

```

How could we deal with this issue? (Hint: check out Lec. 5 slide 20)...
